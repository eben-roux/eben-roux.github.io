<p>Sometimes it is difficult to explain things that appear to be extremely simple.&nbsp; I guess this is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge">tacit knowledge</a> comes into the picture.&nbsp; It may very well be that service orientation falls into this category.</p>
<p>Let's say that I wanted to pay a bill 50 years ago by sending my creditor a cheque by mail.&nbsp; I also expect a letter in reply stating that my cheque has been received.&nbsp; I firstly place my&nbsp;cheque, along with some relevant information, in an envelope and write the address of the creditor to send the mail to on the front.&nbsp; I could also write the return address on the back.&nbsp; I would need to add a stamp to the envelope to demonstrate payment of the requested service.&nbsp; Next I would place the letter envelope in a post box.&nbsp; If everything is in order I can reasonably expect the recipient to receive the letter.&nbsp; I can assume that the post office will provide the expected <strong><em>service</em></strong>.&nbsp; Of course, this doesn't mean that the service will be provided as expected.&nbsp; There are a number of things that could go wrong but we'll hope for the best.&nbsp; So service orientation has been around for a while.</p>
<p>I, as the user of the mail system, see a very <strong><em>coarse-grained</em></strong> service,&nbsp; Within the post office there are many different services of varying granularity (some&nbsp;quite <strong><em>fine-grained</em></strong>)&nbsp;provided by different departments.</p>
<p>Now, although we expect a response from the creditor I am pretty sure that very few people will run off to their own post box and expect the reply to pop in; nor will they wait for the response.&nbsp; It is assumed that it will take a couple of days.</p>
<p>Let's jump back to the present and send an e-mail to a creditor.&nbsp; Once again, we expect a reply but we will not be watching our e-mail client application all day to see when it comes in.&nbsp; Again we expect some time to pass but hopefully not a couple of days.&nbsp; So our service will be completed <strong><em>eventually</em></strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand some services are expected to be completed <strong><em>immediately</em></strong>.&nbsp; It depends on how consistent our information needs to be at any one time.&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp; I have a bank account with no overdraft facility.&nbsp; I draw my last ZAR100 from an ATM.&nbsp; Since my wife may draw money using the same account from another ATM I guess that bank would prefer that she not draw <em>"the last ZAR100"</em> also.&nbsp; So the first transaction would block the second until it has been updated after which the second would fail since there would be insufficient funds.&nbsp; There <em>may </em>be no place for eventual consistency here.&nbsp; I say 'may' because the bank could decide to allow such behaviour and simply impose penalties.</p>
