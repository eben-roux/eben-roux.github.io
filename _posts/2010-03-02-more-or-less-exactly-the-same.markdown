<p>In high school I had a maths teacher that would show us various problems with solutions and simply state that they are "More or less exactly the same".</p>
<p>I recently came across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a>.&nbsp; This got me thinking about how we humans approach some things in a really weird way.&nbsp; I mean, having a random number generator create the complete works of Shakespeare (or <em>any</em> body of work for that matter) is just plain silly.&nbsp; The probability is somehow <em>calculated</em>.&nbsp; Now, I believe some things are not possible, or even probable.</p>
<p>When one switches on a television that has not been tuned you see some form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian Movement</a>.&nbsp; This seems quite random to me.&nbsp; In fact, we can simulate the same thing using a computer and simply place dots all over the display; something, I'm sure, most programmers have done at some stage while learning to code.</p>
<div>Taking into account how many possible images exist one may expect that at <em>some</em> stage a recognizable image would appear.&nbsp; It never will.&nbsp; It seems strange to say that since the probability associated with a recognizable image is now a big fat 0.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>What is the probability of taking a tour through the universe and digging through every single planet and finding a perfectly formed clay brick.&nbsp; I mean, a simple brick.&nbsp; Not something that <em>looks </em>like a brick.&nbsp; Even that seems strange.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The big thing is that we have intelligence on our side.&nbsp; Our DNA contains informattion that didn't appear at random.&nbsp; Having a bunch of monkeys type up the text in the latest copy of People magazine seems trivial compared to that.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>To summarise: saying something is so doesn't necesaarily make it so, even if you use a mathematical model.<br /></div>
