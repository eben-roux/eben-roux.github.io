<p>Sounds silly, right?</p>
<p>But it is interesting looking at something like the <a title="Dreyfus model of skill acquisition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</a> and pulling that through to software development and what I have experienced over the years.&nbsp; Now whenever there is a paradigm shift one inevitably goes back to the Novice level.&nbsp; The fact that one has been doing something A for 10 years <em>may </em>not count for much when I move to something B.&nbsp; I say <em>may not</em> because A and B may be related, so I may not end up way back on the Novice level.</p>
<p>I think the fact that software development is such an immensely broad field makes it terribly difficult to guage who fits in where.&nbsp; Coupled to this is the fact that software development is only a means to an end.&nbsp; That end is the automation of some domain that, in most cases, have absolutely nothing to do with software development: e.g. Accounting, Inventory, Steel Sheet Cutting, Medicine, Asset Management, ...<em>n</em>.</p>
<p>It is also extremely difficult to <em>convince</em> someone that they are on the wrong path.&nbsp; Hopefully, you yourself are on the correct path, that is, at a higher level of skill.</p>
<p>Another obstacle is open-mindedness.&nbsp; Sometimes folks are set in their ways.&nbsp; They have no intentions to learn anything new since what they have gets the job done just fine.&nbsp; So maybe that is why like-minded individuals are required in very small teams to get the job done.</p>
