Yesterday I received my first *free* [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) Open Source license from [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) for use with [shuttle-esb](http://shuttle.github.io/shuttle-esb/).

I am totally thrilled by this as I have been using ReSharper for a good number of years and find it absolutely amazing that they assist open source software in this way.

So a big *thank you* to JetBrains!
