For the last couple of weeks (as at 21 February 2015) my Dell Inspiron 17R SE has been periodically "freezing" for about half a second with a buzzing sound when there is audio.

After some Internet searching I came across this [latency checker](http://www.thesycon.de/deu/latency_check.shtml):

![DPC Latency Checker]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dpc-latency-checker.png "DPC Latency Checker")

Every-so-often a red bar would appear when the machine "freezes", with the buzzing sound, indicating some latency.

Some more searching led me to the [xperf tool](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ntdebugging/archive/2008/04/03/windows-performance-toolkit-xperf.aspx) and I followed [this post](http://www.sysnative.com/forums/windows-7-|-windows-vista-tutorials/5721-how-to-diagnose-and-fix-high-dpc-latency-issues-with-wpa-windows-windows-vista-7-8-a.html):

```
xperf -on DiagEasy
```

I then waited for the red bar to appear in the latency checker and then executed this (in my `d:\xperf` folder):

```
xperf -d trace.etl
```

I then double-clicked the `trace.etl` file in Windows Explorer and identified the *Dell Data Vault* as the culprit:

Some more searching then brought me to this [Dell community page](http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3524/t/19618282).  I tried disabling the *Dell Diag Control Device * but that didn't help and then, as indicated further down, I disabled the * Dell Data Vault* and * Dell Data Vault Wizard* services.

That did the trick.  

Quite a frustrating exercise and I would have expected better from Dell :(
