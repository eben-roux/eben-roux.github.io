### Art

It seems, to me, to be a reasonable assumption that most people could learn to, say, paint.  The basics would entail some sort of paint (water, acryllic, oil) and a brush or two.  The result, however, are going to differ quite markedly from one person to the next.  

Most people may not have a passion for painting and don't bother.  Others have a great passion and delve quite deeply into the subject.  They'll study the history, all the relevant techniques, and the technical side of things such as canvas preparation and the like.

If you cannot paint and need a painting you would need to hire/commission someone to do the work.  This could get interesting and the costs are going to vary greatly.  Let's say you own a chapel called the Sistine and you would like to have the ceiling painted.  You put out a request for proposals and soon you have many proposals pouring in.  You RFP contains the basics of what you'd like to see; almost a type of basic *requirement*.  

In amongst the mix is a chap called Michelangelo but he is quite expensive.  You have heard of him and even seen some of his work.  It is impressive but darn... that price tag.  You decide to rather employ a group of 20 *junior* painters that have just completed their studies at the *Da Vinci School of fine arts and flying machines*.  Not only do you get 20 painters but it is half the price and they promise to finish the work in 2 years and not the 4 estimated by the grand master.

However, after 3 years you notice that the qulity of the work is not up to scratch and the budget and timelines have been blown out of the water.  There is even a painting of a yellow sponge-like chap with a starfish friend.  Things look bad and you decide to send for Michelangelo.  You ask Michelangelo to fix and finish the artwork in 10 months.  He kindly refuses the offer.

There is quite a bit of creativity involved in art and either you have that inate ability or you don't.  Creativity cannot be learnt.  Every person completing a course in some form of artwork is not necessarily going to be another Mechelangelo.

*I know nothing about painting.*

### Music

It also seems, to me, to be a reasonable assumption that most people could learn play to, say, the piano.  There are keys that you push down on and the relevant note is produced.  Once you have mastered a couple of chords and perhaps hooked up your electronic piano to a computer you can start creating music.  If it weren't for a computer where I can edit my own compositions note-for-note I wouldn't be able to create anything since I cannot play a paino using both my hands.

When you need to create your own music there is a level of creativity involved.  You could create anything from a jingle to a film score.  The ability of the composer is quite relevant to the goal.  Again, if you use folks that have just completed a course from a music school to create your film score you *may* run into problems.

### Programming

Programming is also something that most people could learn.  The basic constructs of any programming language are:

- Sequence
- Selection (conditional operators)
- Repetition (loops)

However, to successfully create a solution there is a good measure of creativity required.  There are many moving parts that need to come together just right for software to be successful.  It is quite difficult to measure but you tend to know it when you see it.

## Analysis and Synthesis

*Analysis* is the breaking down of something into simpler components.  *Synthesis* is putting simpler components together to create something.

In analysing requirements we could go bonkers and break down the requirements into something that is too generic.  In some cases we may need some generic abstraction that can be combined into something useful.  An example may be a rule engine.

If the person performing the analysis does not correctly do so then a programmer is not going to be able to produce the correct result.
