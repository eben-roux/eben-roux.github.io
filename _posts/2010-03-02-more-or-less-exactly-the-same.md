In high school I had a maths teacher that would show us various problems with solutions and simply state that they are "More or less exactly the same".

I recently came across the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a>. This got me thinking about how we humans approach some things in a really weird way. I mean, having a random number generator create the complete works of Shakespeare (or _any body of work for that matter) is just plain silly. The probability is somehow _calculated. Now, I believe some things are not possible, or even probable.

When one switches on a television that has not been tuned you see some form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian Movement</a>. This seems quite random to me. In fact, we can simulate the same thing using a computer and simply place dots all over the display; something, I'm sure, most programmers have done at some stage while learning to code.

<div>Taking into account how many possible images exist one may expect that at _some stage a recognizable image would appear. It never will. It seems strange to say that since the probability associated with a recognizable image is now a big fat 0.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What is the probability of taking a tour through the universe and digging through every single planet and finding a perfectly formed clay brick. I mean, a simple brick. Not something that _looks like a brick. Even that seems strange.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The big thing is that we have intelligence on our side. Our DNA contains informattion that didn't appear at random. Having a bunch of monkeys type up the text in the latest copy of People magazine seems trivial compared to that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>To summarise: saying something is so doesn't necesaarily make it so, even if you use a mathematical model.</div>
