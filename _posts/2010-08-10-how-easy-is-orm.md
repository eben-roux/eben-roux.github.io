I subscribe to [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/) newsletters. So this morning I receive one with the following blog post:

> [Mixing Table Per Hierarchy and Entity Splitting](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/100109/Mixing-Table-Per-Hierarchy-and-Entity-Splitting.aspx)

And all I can ask myself is how this makes anything easier?

**Just do your own mapping and be done with it already.**
