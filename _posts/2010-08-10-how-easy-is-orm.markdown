<p>I subscribe to <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">Code Project</a> newsletters.&nbsp; So this morning I receive one with the following blog post:</p>
<p id="ctl00_TitleArea_ArticleTitle"><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/100109/Mixing-Table-Per-Hierarchy-and-Entity-Splitting.aspx">Mixing Table Per Hierarchy and Entity Splitting</a></p>
<p>And all I can ask myself is how this makes anything easier?</p>
<p><strong>Just do your own mapping and be done with it already.</strong></p>
