<p>For an overview you can take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age">New Age</a> articles on wikipedia.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'" (Genesis 11:4)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The <strong>New Age</strong> (also known as the <strong>New Age Movement</strong>, <strong>New Age spirituality</strong>, and <strong>Cosmic Humanism</strong>) is a decentralized Western social and spiritual movement that seeks "Universal Truth" and the attainment of the highest individual <span class="mw-redirect">human potential</span>.</p>
<p>Just a little something to thinhk about.&nbsp; Many of the secular movements (Communism, Secular Humanism, Cosmin Humanism) place man at the center and rely on man's ability.&nbsp; So "how's that working for you?".</p>
